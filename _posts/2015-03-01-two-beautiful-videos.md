title: Two beautiful videos
---

# {{ page.title }}

I’ve been bookmarking some videos for use here. Originally, I was going to try to mash several videos of different styles into one post. A little science fiction, a little humor, a loud song to pump you up. But these two are so beautiful that I thought they should stand alone.

The first is a set of 3D-printed objects based on Fibonacci numbers illuminated by a strobe light while spinning. The effect is mesmerizing.

The second shows scenes of humanity exploring the solar system coupled with Carl Sagan reading from his book *Pale Blue Dot*.

Somewhat related: I’m currently reading Isaac Asimov’s *Foundation*. More on that soon, I think.
