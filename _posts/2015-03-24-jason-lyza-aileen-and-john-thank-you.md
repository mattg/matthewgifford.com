Seven (or eight ðŸ˜‰) years ago, you <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-end-of-mobile-portland/">created something special</a> for Portlandâ€™s tech community.

Please take a minute to think of the thousands of lives (directly and indirectly) that were improved. The education and inspiration they gained from the presentations. The connections made and opportunities opened up because of the diverse community you brought together.
