Earlier this year, <a href="/2015/03/29/notes-on-azimovs-foundation/">I wrote</a> about Isaac Asimov’s science fiction classic, *Foundation*. More accurately, I wrote about my dislike for his writing style.

Despite its flaws, I enjoyed *Foundation* enough that I decided to read the next book in the series, *Foundation and Empire*. Just a few pages in, it became clear that this was going to be another book of one-dimensional, similar-sounding character/narrators having awkward conversations.

Most of the first chapter is a conversation between an old man from the planet Siwenna, Ducem Barr, and a general, Bel Riose. Its purpose is to set the stage for the rest of the story.

<blockquote>The aged Siwennian stared unblinkingly, and Riose continued, “You had better tell me what you know-”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Barr said thoughtfully, “It would be interesting to tell you certain things. It would be a psychohistoric experiment of my own.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What kind of experiment?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Psychohistoric.” The old man had an unpleasant edge to his smile. Then, crisply, “You’d better have more tea. I’m going to make a bit of a speech.”</blockquote>

Oh, boy. Here we go again.

<blockquote>Barr smiled grimly, and continued, “My father was a Patrician of the Empire and a Senator of Siwenna. His name was Onum Barr.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Riose interrupted impatiently, “I know the circumstances of his exile very well. You needn’t elaborate upon it.”</blockquote>

I share your impatience, Riose.

<blockquote>The Siwennian ignored him and proceeded without deflection.</blockquote>

Did Asimov’s ghost just give me the middle finger?

I do wonder if Asimov was sending a message to his readers. Was he making a joke about his clunky writing? Was he firing back at critics? *Were* people critical of his writing back then?

Or am I reading a deeper meaning into something that has none? I do tend to do that.
