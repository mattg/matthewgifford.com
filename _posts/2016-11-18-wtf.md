# {{ page.title }}

Anxiety, hopelessness, disbelief, fear, disappointment, disgust, anger. That’s how the last two weeks have been for me. The morning after the election, I realized I needed to make some changes. I’d spent the last year wallowing in the social media mud with the pigs, with nothing to show for it. Continuing to do so would only magnify my negative emotions, cloud my thinking, and make me lethargic.

I decided to be more conscious about my media diet and the people I interact with. Less Twitter and Facebook. More long articles, books, and magazines. More writing and making. Cut ties with a handful of people. Stop feeding the trolls.

The world needs more positive, rational, productive people to push back against the stupid shit that’s happening right now.

Here are a few of the good things I’ve paid attention to this week. I hope you will find them interesting and pass them on to others.

* <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler">Conversations with Tyler</a> is a podcast hosted by economist Tyler Cowen. Topics discussed include just about everything: food, politics, music, science, language, etc. You might be surprised how interesting a <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/steven-pinker-language-instinct-evolutionary-psychology-darwin-chomsky-linguistics-b792d7cd2a05#.v682u0k7n">conversation about irregular verbs</a> can be.
* <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/five-independent-signs-of-new-physics-in-the-universe-cda62bedea0#.6dd1im2pn">Five independent signs of new physics in the Universe</a>. Even though I don’t have a good understanding of particle physics, I like to read articles about it. They remind me how mysterious and strange our universe is.
* I just discovered that Deerhoof, one of my favorite bands, has a <a href="https://famousclass.bandcamp.com/track/risk-free">new EP</a> out.
* “It’s like, ‘how much more black could this be?’ and the answer is ‘None. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0_fID_jvA">None more black</a>.’”

If you have anything cool to share, please leave a response. We need more good to push out the bad.
