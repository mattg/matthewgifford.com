Happy Thanksgiving! I hope you were able to spend some quality time with people you love yesterday. But sometimes we need a little break from the family. Especially if some of them made a terrible choice on November 8.

If you need something to do over the long weekend, here are a few things to read and listen to. <a href="/2016/11/18/wtf/">Last week</a>, I wrote that I enjoy reading articles about physics. We start off with another one this week:

* Light can behave as a particle and a wave. Until a couple years ago, scientists had never been able to directly observe light behaving as both simultaneously. <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-03-particle.html">This crazy experiment</a> allowed them do it.
* A recent episode of the Planet Money podcast, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/11/18/502475485/episode-736-messy-nobel">*Messy Nobel*</a>, introduced me to a creative tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies">Oblique Strategies</a>. Of course, there are apps for it. The one I put on my Android phone is called, not surprisingly, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shaunchurch.obliquestrategies&amp;hl=en">Oblique Strategies</a>.
* Speaking of messy: <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/82-hello/">episode 82 of Reply All</a>. A glorious mess. The show’s hosts decided to take calls from anyone for 48 hours. It’s a reminder that ordinary humanity can be such a beautiful thing.
* One final mess: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNFsbeAAzLT/">Pizza Jerk’s It’s Always Sunny in Cully</a>. Pepperoni, pineapple, hot peppers, basil, and honey. This pizza shouldn’t work. But I’m sure it’s genius. I can’t believe I haven’t been there yet.
