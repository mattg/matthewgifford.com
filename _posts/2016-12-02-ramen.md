I wish I could have this ramen every day. It’s *amazing*.

I don’t have much else to write about. Just trying to focus on getting though all my projects and the holidays with my sanity intact.

Here are a few interesting things from this week:

* “No one expects the lady code troll.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wewAC5X_CZ8">Jenn Schiffer’s very funny talk</a> at this year’s XOXO Festival exposes some awful behavior in the tech community.
* Most people think that the next logical place for humans to colonize in the solar system would be either our moon or Mars. It turns out that Saturn’s moon <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/lets-colonize-titan/">Titan is probably the best choice</a>.
* NEXT Architects’ <a href="http://thecoolhunter.net/lucky-knot-bridge-changsha-china/">Lucky Knot Bridge</a> in Changsha, China. We need more of this in Portland.
* The <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/11/29/503711921/new-mix-laura-marling-weyes-blood-sam-phillips-more">latest episode</a> of the All Songs Considered podcast exposed me to a bunch of excellent new music. I’m particularly impressed by the latest album, <a href="https://friendsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/honey">*Honey*</a>, from a duo called Peals.️️
