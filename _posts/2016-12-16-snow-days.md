# {{ page.title }}

Between trying to get projects done, learning new things to get those projects done, the whole family being at home due to being snowed-in, and getting ready for Christmas and its associated parties, I haven’t had a lot of time to think this week. So, this update is going to be short.

<blockquote>Inspiration is for amateurs — the rest of us just show up and get to work. — Chuck Close</blockquote>

This is one of my favorite quotes. Obviously, it applies to your job. But lately I’m realizing that it applies to pretty much everything in life: work, creativity, relationships, self-improvement, etc. Nothing happens if you don’t show up and do the work. And doing the work makes you better at doing the work in the future.

## Satsumas

Citrus fruit is fascinating. It’s so much more than oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, and tangerines. It’s actually an enormous spectrum of hybrids. Some people spend a lot of time and money collecting rare and obscure varieties. This article about why <a href="https://theawl.com/satsuma-mandarins-are-the-best-citrus-a35377e6cd1d#.lnoih1c83">Satsumas are the best citrus</a> is a good introduction.

## Flashing lights

Scientists have made an <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/bringing-gamma-back/">astonishing discovery</a> about Alzheimer’s disease. It’s the stuff of science fiction.

And, that’s it for this week. I hope you have a great weekend!
