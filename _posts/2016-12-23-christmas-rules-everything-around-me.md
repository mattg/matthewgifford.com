I have a love/hate relationship with the holiday season. I love celebrating Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve. I love the parties. I love being with people.

But all the planning and logistics that goes into this stuff wears me out. And, honestly, I don’t do 1% of what my wife does. I don’t know how she does it.

Looking forward to life slowing down a little so I can sit and think.
