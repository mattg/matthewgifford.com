# {{ page.title }}

Sitting at the kitchen table on a Friday night, thinking about 2016. Trying to figure out how to sum it all up. I don’t think I can. Too much happened. Too much emotion. It’s just too much.

I’ll say this: It was the best and worst year all at the same time.

Most of us would agree that we’re glad to see the end of 2016. Many are worried that 2017 is going to be even worse. I’m not so sure. I think 2016 was so awful because it was constantly surprising. And not in a good way.

2017 is going to be tough. The unexpected will continue to happen. People will continue to say and do appalling things. But we should be expecting it now. We ought to be prepared to fight.

And by fighting, I don’t just mean attacking the things we don’t agree with, which we certainly must do. We also need to be smarter, more creative, more productive, more honest, more loving. To build the kind of world that we want. Because one thing is clear: Nobody is going to do it for us.

That’s what my 2017 is going to be about.
