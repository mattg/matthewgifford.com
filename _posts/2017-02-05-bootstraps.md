<h2 class="kicker">Weekend notes: 2/5/17</h2>

# {{ page.title }}

Regular readers of my posts might have noticed that I’ve renamed the weekly updates from <em>Friday notes</em> to <em>Weekend notes</em>. There are a couple reasons for this:

<ol>
  <li>Getting something written during the workweek to post every Friday morning, which was the original plan, has become too difficult. The last couple have been posted on Friday evenings, which appears to be the absolute worst time to post something if you want people to actually see it.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of newsletters sent out on Friday. I’d like to see if posting during a less noisy time will help my posts get a little more attention.</li>
</ol>

## MLK on the bootstrap myth

<blockquote>It’s all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.</blockquote>

Martin Luther King Jr. said this in a sermon at the National Cathedral in 1968. I’d not heard it before this week.

It’s definitely something to think about, considering the enormous amounts of homelessness, both for refugees and U.S. citizens, we’re seeing today. Sadly, much of this sermon is still relevant.

## Time crystals

Time crystals sound like something from a Marvel movie. But they’re not. <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/01/26/scientists-unveil-new-form-of-matter-time-crystals/">They’re real</a>. Two separate groups of scientists have created matter that has a repetitive structure over time, rather than over space.

## Pet video

My 7-year-old son received a GoPro camera for Christmas. He’s starting to learn how to edit and upload his videos. This one is my favorite so far. It would be nice if you checked it out and offered him some encouragement. We have to do something about those titles, though.
