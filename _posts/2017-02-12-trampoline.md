# {{ page.title }}

This winter has been very wet, windy, and cold, even by western Oregon standards. Our kids and dogs, who don’t mind getting soaked and muddy, have been avoiding going outside. We were all starting to go a little crazy because the kids weren’t able to burn their excess energy.

Yesterday we got a break from the awful weather. No rain. No wind. The sun was visible for more than a minute at a time. It was still chilly, but nobody cared.

We spent much of the afternoon working in the back yard. The first thing we did was assemble a large trampoline, the parts of which had been sitting in the garage for weeks.

While the kids exhausted themselves on the trampoline, Angela and I worked on boring grown-up stuff. We dug a few tree stumps out of the ground. We also planted a combination apple tree and a combination plum tree.

It felt great to get outside for a few hours and make some improvements to our piece of the world. I’m very much looking forward to spring.

## Mastery

On Tuesday, I finished Robert Greene’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_%28book%29"><em>Mastery</em></a>. I’d been reading it sporadically for about a year.

I wish this book had been around twenty years ago when I needed help figuring out what to do with my life. It might have saved me a lot of pain.

I will probably end up writing more about it soon. But I think I need to skim back through it first.
