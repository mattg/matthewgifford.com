<h2 class="kicker">Weekend Notes: 7/10/17</h2>

# {{ page.title }}

It’s been far too long since I last posted here. This was supposed to be a weekly thing. Yeah right. I don’t have a lot to share this week, but I need to get the ball rolling again.

I spent most of the weekend doing mindless chores around the house. This gave me a lot of time to listen to music, podcasts, and books. I got to the end of my podcast queue pretty quickly, so I had to find new things to listen to. Here are a few of the standouts.

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.levarburtonpodcast.com/">LeVar Burton Reads</a> is basically Reading Rainbow for adults. Every week, LeVar Burton reads a short story, then talks a little about what it means to him. The selections so far have been excellent.</li>
  <li>In <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com">Revisionist History</a>, Malcolm Gladwell examines a bit of history that he feels is forgotten or misunderstood. I thouroughly enjoyed the first season. I was unaware that the second season had started. Of the episodes that have been released so far, the <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/11-a-good-walk-spoiled">episode about private golf clubs in Los Angeles</a> was my favorite. I really hate golf.</li>
  <li>I’ve been reading the Google Play Books version of Cal Newport’s <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a>. While the book contained a lot of useful information, it started to feel like a bit of a slog about two-thirds of the way through. I decided to have my phone read the remainder to me. I highly recommend the book. But it could’ve been a little shorter.</li>
</ul>

What have you been listening to lately? I could use something new for my commute.
