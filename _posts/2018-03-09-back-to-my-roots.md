In 2015, after years of neglecting my long-running blog, I admitted to myself that I had lost interest in posting hot takes on tech and politics. I still had the urge to write. But it was going to have to be something new.

At first, I dabbled with writing an email newsletter largely about creativity, which was becoming a hip thing to do among disillusioned bloggers. Having a more direct connection between writer and reader was nice. But, being a web zealot, I was uncomfortable with my writing disappearing into the ether, never to be seen again. You never know if someone will find value in some trivial thing you’ve made.

My next attempt was Medium. If I remember correctly, they had recently opened publications up to everyone, which made it seem like a good replacement for a blog. Although I didn’t write nearly as much as I had planned to, I wrote a lot more than I had on my old blog. The posts were longer and more thoughtful. Some of them were actually being read and commented on.

But after a couple years of doing this, I realized that I had exchanged ownership of my writing for an audience that never really materialized. This isn’t Medium’s fault. There are a lot of writers who have found success there. I just haven’t put in the effort to make things work. And, the longer that I continued to publish on Medium, the more difficult it would be to move elsewhere.

A few weeks ago, I decided to bring everything back [home](http://www.matthewgifford.com/). Thanks to Medium for making it easy to export my data. Even so, editing that data so it works for me has taken a lot of work. Medium uses a lot of markup to make people's words so pretty.

This morning, I got things to “good enough”. If you run into any rough edges, please [let me know](mailto:hello@matthewgifford.com).
