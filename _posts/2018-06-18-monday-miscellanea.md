Anthony Bourdain was an [extraordinary person](http://davidsimon.com/tony/). That he‚Äôs no longer with us still destroys me. The world needs more Tonys and less of the garbage people who are running things these days.

A couple months ago, I [mentioned](http://matthewgifford.com/2018/04/14/weekend-notes/) that I wanted to start playing Dungeons & Dragons again. On a whim, we bought the necessary books and dice and Angela set up a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/206805406796591). I‚Äôm very happy that we did it.

If you didn‚Äôt read the New Yorker article about [D&D‚Äôs resurgence](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-uncanny-resurrection-of-dungeons-and-dragons) the last time I posted it, you might want to read it this time.
