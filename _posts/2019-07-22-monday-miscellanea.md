Starting over on the blog with a list of interesting things I've read recently.

- [Elementary Education Has Gone Terribly Wrong](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/the-radical-case-for-teaching-kids-stuff/592765/)
- [How Giving Up TV For A Month Changed My Brain And My Life](https://www.fastcompany.com/3060491/what-happened-to-my-brain-after-a-month-without-watching-tv) - Ever since I lived for a few years without TV, I've been convinced that watching TV is one of the most meaningless things you can do with your time.
- [Giant batteries and cheap solar power are shoving fossil fuels off the grid](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/giant-batteries-and-cheap-solar-power-are-shoving-fossil-fuels-grid)
- [I was wrong about spreadsheets, and Iâ€™m sorry](https://www.reifyworks.com/writing/2017-01-25-i-was-wrong-about-spreadsheets-and-im-sorry)
- [People in Japan are renting cars but not driving them](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683406/japan-car-sharing-renting-not-driving-private-space-orix-times24)
- [Letters to New and Veteran Dungeon Masters](http://slyflourish.com/letters_to_dungeon_masters.html)
- [Stop. Using. Periods. Period.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/13/stop-using-periods-period-2/) - I read this article when it was published two years ago. At that time, I thought it might be right, but continued to use periods after single sentences. I'm finally starting to rethink that practice.
- [The Launch](https://story.californiasunday.com/cosmic-crisp-apple-launch) - Interesting story about the launch of a new variety of apple.
