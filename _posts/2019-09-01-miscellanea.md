I'm going to use up your free NYT articles with this list. They're all worth it, though.

- ___[Our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written. Black Americans have fought to make them true.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/black-history-american-democracy.html)___ — If there's one thing you read from the NYT's _[1619 Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html)_, read this.
- ___[We should all be reading more Ursula Le Guin](https://theoutline.com/post/7886/ursula-le-guin-carrier-bag-theory)___ — One of the things that bothers me about the myths our children learn is that people are either good or bad. Le Guin's books contain worlds filled with gray areas and ambiguity. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to read them.
- ___[We Have Ruined Childhood](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/opinion/sunday/childhood-suicide-depression-anxiety.html)___
- ___[Consume less, create more](https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/)___
- ___[Laziness Does Not Exist](https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01)___
- ___[The Em Dash Divides](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/style/em-dash-punctuation.html)___ — I'm learning to love the em dash.
- ___[The Magic of Swimming Holes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/style/swimming-holes-california.html)___ — You should read Jenny Odell's _[How to Do Nothing](https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast/2019/5/23/18636332/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing)_ as soon as possible. You might mistake it for just another self-help book. It's definitely not that. If you want a bit of a preview, listen to the [interview she did with Ezra Klein](https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast/2019/5/23/18636332/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing) earlier this year.

The best lesson on roleplaying in an RPG ever made:
